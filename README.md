# Simplepy is in its very early stages of development and is not ready for use
#
# The goal of simplepy is to abstract away complexity for simple use cases and create a simple way of getting things done in python
#
# Simplepy is not intended for power programmers that need advanced capability and are therefore perhaps better of directly calling python libraries and accessing any functionality needed
